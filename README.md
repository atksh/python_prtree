# python_prtree

_python_prtree_ is a python/c++ implementation of the Priority R-Tree (see references below), an alternative to R-Tree. The supported futures are as follows:

- Construct a Priority R-Tree (PRTree) from an array of rectangles.
  - `PRTree2D`, `PRTree3D` and `PRTree4D` (2D, 3D and 4D respectively)
- `insert` and `erase`
  - The `insert` method can be passed pickable Python objects instead of int64 indexes.
- `query` and `batch_query`
  - `batch_query` is parallelized by `std::thread` and is much faster than the `query` method.
  - The `query` method has an optional keyword argument `return_obj`; if `return_obj=True`, a Python object is returned.
- `rebuild`
  - It improves performance when many insert/delete operations are called since the last rebuild.
  - Note that if the size changes more than 1.5 times, the insert/erase method also performs `rebuild`.

This package is mainly for **mostly static situations** where insertion and deletion events rarely occur.

## Installation

You can install python_prtree with the pip command:

```bash
pip install python-prtree
```

If the pip installation does not work, please git clone clone and install as follows:

```bash
pip install -U cmake pybind11
git clone --recursive https://github.com/atksh/python_prtree
cd python_prtree
python setup.py install
```

## Examples

```python
import numpy as np
from python_prtree import PRTree2D

idxes = np.array([1, 2])

# rects is a list of (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax)
rects = np.array([[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5],
                  [1.0, 1.5, 1.2, 3.0]])

prtree = PRTree2D(idxes, rects)


# batch query
q = np.array([[0.5, 0.2, 0.6, 0.3],
              [0.8, 0.5, 1.5, 3.5]])
result = prtree.batch_query(q)
print(result)
# [[1], [1, 2]]

# You can insert an additional rectangle by insert method,
prtree.insert(3, np.array([1.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0]))
q = np.array([[0.5, 0.2, 0.6, 0.3],
              [0.8, 0.5, 1.5, 3.5]])
result = prtree.batch_query(q)
print(result)
# [[1], [1, 2, 3]]

# Plus, you can erase by an index.
prtree.erase(2)
result = prtree.batch_query(q)
print(result)
# [[1], [1, 3]]

# Non-batch query is also supported.
print(prtree.query([0.5, 0.5, 1.0, 1.0]))
# [1, 3]

# Point query is also supported.
print(prtree.query([0.5, 0.5]))
# [1]
print(prtree.query(0.5, 0.5))  # 1d-array
# [1]
```

```python
import numpy as np
from python_prtree import PRTree2D

objs = [{"name": "foo"}, (1, 2, 3)]  # must NOT be unique but pickable
rects = np.array([[0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.5],
                  [1.0, 1.5, 1.2, 3.0]])

prtree = PRTree2D()
for obj, rect in zip(objs, rects):
    prtree.insert(bb=rect, obj=obj)

# returns indexes genereted by incremental rule.
result = prtree.query((0, 0, 1, 1))
print(result)
# [1]

# returns objects when you specify the keyword argment return_obj=True
result = prtree.query((0, 0, 1, 1), return_obj=True)
print(result)
# [{'name': 'foo'}]
```

The 1d-array batch query will be implicitly treated as a batch with size = 1.
If you want 1d result, please use `query` method.

```python
result = prtree.query(q[0])
print(result)
# [1]

result = prtree.batch_query(q[0])
print(result)
# [[1]]
```

You can also erase(delete) by index and insert a new one.

```python
prtree.erase(1)  # delete the rectangle with idx=1 from the PRTree

prtree.insert(3, np.array([0.3, 0.1, 0.5, 0.2]))  # add a new rectangle to the PRTree
```

You can save and load a binary file as follows.

```python
# save
prtree.save('tree.bin')


# load with binary file
prtree = PRTree('tree.bin')

# or defered load
prtree = PRTree()
prtree.load('tree.bin')
```

Note that cross-version compatibility is **NOT** guaranteed, so please reconstruct your tree when you update this package.

## New Features and Changes

### `python-prtree>=0.5.8`

- The insert method has been improved to select the node with the smallest mbb expansion.
- The erase method now also executes rebuild when the size changes by a factor of 1.5 or more.

### `python-prtree>=0.5.7`

- You can use PRTree4D.

### `python-prtree>=0.5.3`

- Add compression for pickled objects.

### `python-prtree>=0.5.2`

You can use pickable Python objects instead of int64 indexes for `insert` and `query` methods:

### `python-prtree>=0.5.0`

- Changed the input order from (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, ...) to (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax, ...).
- Added rebuild method to build the PRTree from scratch using the already given data.
- Fixed a bug that prevented insertion into an empty PRTree.

### `python-prtree>=0.4.0`

- You can use PRTree3D:
