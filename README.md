# python_prtree


"python_prtree" is a python implementation of Priority R-Tree (see reference below).
Supported futures are as follows:

- Construct Priority R-Tree(PRTree) from rectangles; an array of (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax) / (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax)
  - Now supports 3D PRTree with python_prtree>=0.4.0
- query and batch query with a rectangle(s)
- insert and erase(delete) (but not optimized yet)

**This package is mainly for nearly static situations, which mean few insert/delete events happen (e.g., map-matching).**

# Usage 
```python
import numpy as np
from python_prtree import PRTree2D

idxes = np.array([1, 2])  # must be unique because it uses idx as key for hash map
rects = np.array([[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5],
                  [1.0, 1.2, 2.5, 3.0]])  # (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax)

prtree = PRTree2D(idxes, rects)  # initial construction

q = np.array([[0.5, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3],
              [0.8, 1.5, 0.5, 3.5]])
result = prtree.batch_query(q)
print(result)
# [[1], [1, 2]]
```

## New features 
### `python-prtree>=0.4.0`
You can use PRTree3D:

```python
import numpy as np
from python_prtree import PRTree3D

idxes = np.array([1, 2])  # must be unique because it uses idx as key for hash map
rects = np.array([[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5, 0.0, 0.5],
                  [1.0, 1.2, 2.5, 3.0, 2.5, 3.0]])  # (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax)

prtree = PRTree3D(idxes, rects)  # initial construction

q = np.array([[0.5, 0.6, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2, 0.3],
              [0.8, 1.5, 0.5, 3.5, 0.5, 3.5]])
result = prtree.batch_query(q)
print(result)
# [[1], [1, 2]]
```

### `python-prtree>=0.3.0`
You can save and load a binary file as follows:

```python
# save
prtree.save('tree.bin')


# load with binary file
prtree = PRTree('tree.bin')

# or defered load
prtree = PRTree()
prtree.load('tree.bin')
```

Cross-version compatibility is **NOT** guaranteed, so please reconstruct your tree when you update this package.

## Note

The 1d-array batch query will be implicitly treated as a batch with size = 1.
If you want 1d result, please use `query` method.
```python
result = prtree.query(q[0])
print(result)
# [1]

result = prtree.batch_query(q[0])
print(result)
# [[1]]
```


You can also erase(delete) by index and insert a new one.
```python
prtree.erase(1)  # delete the rectangle with idx=1 from the PRTree

prtree.insert(3, np.array([0.3, 0.5, 0.1, 0.2]))  # add a new rectangle to the PRTree
```

# Installation
To install python_prtree with pip command
```bash
pip install python-prtree
```

Or, you can clone and install just like
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/atksh/python_prtree
cd python_prtree
python setup.py install
```
This installation needs cmake.

# Requirement
- numpy


# NOTE

- C++ implements this PRTree with Pybind11 and much faster than the numba implementation of PRTree.
- If you can use C++, you should use boost::geometry (I did not know it and sadly made this package).
- Please note that insert / erase operations are not optimized compared to ordinary r-tree. Plus, this implementation does not exactly follow that of the paper due to my technical skills.
